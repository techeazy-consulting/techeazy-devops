# 🚀 DevOps Internship Project – AWS EC2, S3, Terraform & GitHub Actions
This project demonstrates how to provision, configure, and deploy EC2 instances using Terraform and GitHub Actions. It includes S3 bucket management, IAM roles, and a CI/CD pipeline with multi-environment support (dev, qa, prod).


## ✅ Assignments Covered

- Assignment 1: EC2 provisioning with Java install, GitHub repo clone, and app deployment.

- Assignment 2: S3 Bucket creation with lifecycle policies, IAM roles (read-only/write-only), and log uploads.

- Assignment 3: CI/CD pipeline for multi-stage deployments (dev, qa, prod) using GitHub Actions.

- Assignment 4: CI/CD pipeline enhancement with parameterized multi-stage automation, Private/Public GitHub Config Handling, and environment-based log routing.


## 🧰 Prerequisites
- AWS Account (with access key/secret)

- GitHub Account

- GitHub Secrets configured:

     - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

     - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

     - GH_TOKEN (with repo access)

- S3 bucket already created (for remote Terraform state)

## ✅ Assignment Summary
📌 **Assignment 1: EC2 Instance Deployment using Terraform**
     
  - Provision an EC2 instance using Terraform.

  - Automatically install Java, clone a GitHub repo, and run your app.

  - Configure user_data using a shell script for automation.

📌 **Assignment 2: EC2 + S3 Integration**
     
  - Create an S3 bucket with:

       - Private access

       - Lifecycle configuration

  - Assign IAM roles to EC2 with S3 read/write permissions.

  - Logs from EC2 are pushed to the respective stage’s S3 path.

  - Validate S3 access using aws s3 ls and role permissions.

📌 **Assignment 3: CI/CD Multi-Stage Deployment with GitHub Actions**

  - Setup GitHub Actions to handle:

       - Deployment (deploy.yml)

       - Destruction (destroy.yml)

  - Use tags like deploy-dev, deploy-qa, etc., or manual trigger with environment input.

  - Environments: dev, qa, prod

  - Health check added post-deployment to validate the running app on port 80.

📌 **Assignment 4: Enhanced CI/CD Automation with Secure GitHub Integration**

  - Parameterized multi-stage deployment using Terraform and GitHub Actions.  

  - Secure GitHub token management for private/public repos.  

  - Automatically clone repo using token if private; skip if public.  

  - S3 logs are uploaded to `s3://your-bucket-name/logs/<stage>/` post deployment.  
  
  - Includes health check verification step to validate successful app deployment.
  
## 🚀 How It Works

**1️⃣ Trigger Deployment**

Via GitHub:

 - Go to Actions > Deploy to EC2

 - Click Run workflow

 - Select environment: dev / qa / prod

 - Or push a tag like: deploy-dev, deploy-prod, deploy-qa

**2️⃣ GitHub Actions Flow (deploy.yml)**

 - Sets environment stage based on input or tag

 - Initializes and validates Terraform

 - Applies configuration using stage.json

 - Waits for EC2 to be ready

 - Performs health check on port 80

**3️⃣ EC2 Instance Setup**

 - Runs user_data shell script:

 - Installs Java

 - Clones your GitHub repository

 - Starts the application

 - Uploads logs to S3 in path:

       s3://your-bucket-name/logs/dev/
       s3://your-bucket-name/logs/qa/
       s3://your-bucket-name/logs/prod/

**4️⃣ Monitor Deployment**

  - The workflow run will start and show progress in GitHub Actions

  - Green checkmarks indicate successful steps

**5️⃣ Destroy Infrastructure**

To tear down:

  - Go to Actions > Destroy EC2 Infrastructure

  - Run workflow and select the stage


## 🧪 Health Check Logic

 - After EC2 deployment, GitHub Actions:

     - Waits for public IP

     - Pings http://<EC2_IP> on port 80


## 📌 Notes
    
    1. Each stage uses its own .json config and shell script.

    2. Terraform backend is stored in S3.

    3. IAM role policies ensure only that instance can access its environment's logs.
